/* A JavaScript String is a sequence of characters, typically used to represent text.
In JavaScript, there is no character type (Similar to Python and different from C, C++ and Java), 
so a single character string is used when we need a character.
Like Java and Python, strings in JavaScript are immutable. */

//trim() is used to remove either white spaces from the given string. This method returns a new string with removed white spaces.
